     JUSTICE LINK
Voice against police brutality
Extrajudicial killings and police brutality continue to devastate communities where law enforcement often operates without accountability, leaving victims and their families silenced and unsupported. Current reporting mechanisms are fragmented, unsafe, and lack transparency, which hinders justice and systemic reform. JusticeLink addresses these issues by providing a secure, community-driven platform where users can report incidents anonymously or openly, with GPS tagging, timestamping, and multimedia uploads to ensure detailed, verifiable evidence. The app aggregates news reports, government statements, and international reactions, comparing laws and accountability efforts by country, while using data visualizations like graphs and heat maps to help identify perpetrators. Additionally, JusticeLink offers encrypted, anonymous communication and secure file sharing with human rights organizations to protect identities and privacy. Integrated fundraising tools enable direct support to victims' families, amplifying their voices and mobilizing resources for justice and reform
